## Communication & Collaboration Methods

- Primary platform: **Slack**
  - Members must check and respond to messages **daily**.
  - If unresponsive via Slack, follow up via **email**.
- Tools: **Google Drive** and **Slack** for documentation and **GitHub** for development.
- If a task cannot be completed by the soft deadline, notify the group and request assistanceâ€”prioritizing transparency over delays.
- Issues should be resolved internally before escalating to faculty or administration.

---

## Client Communication

- Any team member may contact the client, but:
  - **Written communication** must be reviewed by another team member before sending.
  - **Emails** must include **all group members** in CC.
- Summarize and share key points from **oral communication** (e.g., phone or video calls) with the group.
- Add any client communications to the shared slack tab.

---

## Punctuality & Attendance

- Confirm meeting attendance **at least one day in advance**.
- Notify the group **ASAP** (ideally a day prior, minimum 30 minutes before) if running late or absent.
- Valid excuses: medical emergencies, unavoidable appointments, work or transportation issues.
- Invalid excuses: oversleeping, lack of motivation.
- Failure to notify or provide valid excuse may result in a **strike**.

---

## Meeting Coordination

- **Regular meetings** occur during class hours; others are scheduled as needed.
- Critical meetings (e.g., client calls) require a **majority** of members to be present.
- Tasks will not be assigned to absent members without confirmation of agreement.
- All meetings will be posted on Slack with:
  - Time, date, required attendees, agenda.
- Cancellations will be communicated via Slack and followed up with email if necessary.

---

## Workload & Expectations

- Task assignments based on **skill** and **availability**.
- Everyone must carry a **fair share** of work.
- Refusal to contribute without valid reason = **strike**.
- **Two-tier deadline system**:
  - **Soft Deadline 1:** First draft for peer review.
  - **Soft Deadline 2:** Final version with corrections.
- Missed or low-quality work must be revised by the second deadline.
- Consistent failure to meet expectations may lead to group removal.

---

## Conflict Resolution

- Conduct regular "What's working / What's not?" check-ins.
- Discuss disagreements openly and aim for compromise.
- If no consensus is reached, resolve by **majority vote**.

### Tiebreaker

- For minor conflicts: propose win-win solutions.
- If unresolved, settle with **rock-paper-scissors** (if appropriate).
- Serious issues (e.g., harassment, policy violations) are escalated to program staff immediately and may result in removal.

---

## Strike System

- Strikes are formal warnings for failure to meet responsibilities.
- Logged in a **version-controlled file** visible to the team and instructor.
- **Three strikes = removal** from the group.

### Strike Examples:

- Repeated, unnotified absences
- Lack of meaningful contribution
- Disrupting group harmony
- Ignoring communications or deadlines

Illegal or policy-violating behavior will be reported to program administration immediately.

---

## Member Removal Policy

- Remaining members must gather evidence and submit it to the instructor.
- Upon approval by the program administrator, the member will be removed.
- Any further coordination will involve the program administration directly.
